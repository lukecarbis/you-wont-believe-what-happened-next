Manage expectations - No takeaways, just a story

#### Never stop searching for better opportunities
* Job interview with culture kings, Brisbane
* Call same day from Dave
* March 2014

#### Trust your ability to learn
* Deep end
* New to a Github workflow
* New to unit testing
* New to code review

#### Core contributors are people, too
* X-team had this thing about superheroes (it was cool in the naughties)
* Went to WordCamp Austin, 2014
* Launched Stream 1.4, with a pricing model: Premium Extensions
* Working with Weston Ruter
* WP Celebs
	* Jen Mylo
	* Andrew Nacin
	* Siobhan don't know her last name
	* Sam Sidler
* Story about getting plugin approved by Otto
* Don't be intimidated by people smarter than you

#### Validate, then go hard
* We weren't seeing hardly any sales for our premium extensions
* It was a model working for some people, like Woo and Gravity Forms, but we just didn't have the user base to make it worthwhile
* We never really validated the idea properly

* We had three options at this point:
	* Stick with Premium Extensions
	* Pivot
	* Abandon ship
	
* In hindsight, I think we should have taken the first option
* We never took the time to build up our user base
* It was 2014, so we chose to pivot

#### Setup for success, not acquisition
* Thoughts have creative power
* Idea for Stream 2.0 (Jason Cohen, Sam Hotchkiss)
* Validated, started work on it right away
* Employed the right people to make it happen:
	* Japh, Michele and Maxim
* Started talking about acquisition and equity
* Forced me to consider whether I'd be putting my own money in
* Red flag, which I ignored, didn't want to deal with
* "Jetstream"
* We asked ourselves "Where does Stream truly belong?" - we answered with Jetpack
* We targeted acquisition by Automattic, which was a mistake
* Don't invest (time, money) in what is ultimately one person's decision
* Sometimes having an investor can be bad for the business

#### Start small, fail fast
* A lot of backlash when we launched Stream 2.0
* Privacy concerns
	* Hosting in the US
	* EU data storage laws
* Log in with WordPress.com
* I don't think we could have avoided this, even by asking people about it first
* I'm not sure if we'd get the same sort of reaction if we launched Stream 2.0 a year earlier or later
* Bad timing
* We could have communicated better
* We attended WordCamp SF, started acquisition talks
* Dragged on and on, to save money, I was contracted out
* We wouldn't have done that if we were focusing on acquisition
* Things weren't working, we were spending more than we were making, but we kept everything running
* If I were to do it again, I would set deadlines and stick to them
* If I were to do it again, I would look for a way of achieving cloud storage without a huge team or large infrastructure, slowly growing it
	* Papertrail (Japh)
	* Self hosted externally

#### Provide value, be honest
* Frankie resigned, the project tanked
* I stepped in, put in some extra work, and put together a proposal
* Was able to save the project
* We ended up being acquired by XWP
* The value for XWP is in recruitment
* My plan was to make the plugin completely free
* I needed to communicate a message about our future
* I wanted to avoid a backlash like 2.0
* Goals were:
	* Explain why the change was happening
	* Do the right thing by our existing users and paying customers
	* Make it clear that Stream wouldn't become abandonware
* I wrote and rewrote our announcement, getting lots of feedback along the way
* It contained all the right things, but it really just felt like fake, marketing hype
* In the end the announcement I came up with received really great feedback, lots of people said it sounded genuine and that they were pleased with the announcement
* All in all, it was a win
